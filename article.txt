In order to facilitate Android developers to analyze the entire system platform or all the information after a certain APP has been running for a period of time, Google has developed the adb bugreport tool. Developers can use the adb bugreport command to get all the logs of the system running information of the .

The command is as follows:

adb bugreport> bugreport_out.txt

All log information is output to the bugreport_out.txt file.

Of course, obtaining log information is only the first step. Because the finished bugreport command generates a file might find that there are a dozen M , to analyze a dozen M of txt file is simply a nightmare. So Google has developed a battery historian analysis tool specifically for systems above 5.0 .

Proceed as follows:

1.Download chkbugreport.jar from jar dir

2. Get system log information
adb bugreport > bugreport.txt

or 
adb bugreport report.zip then it will get the whole zip out of which if you will extract it you will get bugreport.txt file so you can use it for further

3. Parse log file
Execute the following commands in the command line:

D:\Temp>java -jar C:\Users\budhdi\Downloads\chkbugreport-0.111.jar D:\Temp\bugreport.txt

After executing this command, a bugreport_out folder is generated in the current directory . This is the analysis result

You can view index .html, where the log is classified and displayed. You will also get the all htm view of process
